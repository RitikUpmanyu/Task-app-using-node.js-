A RESTful-API for a simple task-manager application.

Deployed url- taskapp2020.herokuapp.com
For creating a user you have to send a post request with a appropriate body to "/users".
For logging in too you have to send a post request with a appropriate body to "/users/login".
All the other routes like reading profile, creating task, adding a profile picture etc.
are behind authentication(which you cant acess without logging in).
